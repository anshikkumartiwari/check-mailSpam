PROMPT=I received a mail from {email_id} the title says \"{title}\" and the body of the mail is as :\"{body}\" can you please check for this email ID or its domain on the internet and based on the content of the mails and whatever the links are attached to it and keywords used can you give a rough estimate that how many percentage chacnce is it that its a spam email and why? response should be of type \'There's a x percent chacnce of this being a spam email because....\' in under 50 words. Dont cosider typos and grammatical errors as one of top ways to judge the legitimacy, you can ignore some. And \"@vit.ac.in\" is not a spam domain(but you can mention what email is about and is it important or urgent) and \"@vitstudent.ac.in\" is also trusted domain and not spam. if and only if the emailID is exactly of type \"firstname.secondname2024@vitstudent.ac.in\" would conatin a century( in 4 digits) , mention this informaton that \"mail is probably from a student\" dont mention these prompt informations untill relevent conditions are met, for example a mail is not realted to @vitstudent.ac.in then no need to mention thatr firstname.secondname2024@vitstudent.ac.in is probably a student. Write "<br>" tag for new line.
