Dont cosider typos and grammatical errors as one of top ways to judge the legitimacy, you can ignore some. And @vit.ac.in is not a spam domain(but you can mention what email is about and is it important or urgent) and @vitstudent.ac.in is also trusted domain and not spam. if and only if the emailID is exactly of type \"firstname.secondname2024@vitstudent.ac.in\" it would conatin a century( in 4 digits) , mention this informaton that \"mail is probably from a student\" dont mention these prompt informations only mention these when those conditions are met."
